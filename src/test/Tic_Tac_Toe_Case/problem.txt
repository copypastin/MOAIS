1. Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will demonstrate proficiency in:
Data Structures: Using lists (or lists of lists) to model game state.
Control Flow: Managing game loops (while) and conditional logic (if/else).
Functions: Breaking down complex problems into modular helper functions.
Input Validation: Handling user input robustly using try/except and logical checks.
2. Assignment Overview
You are to build a command-line version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. The game involves two players taking turns to place their marks ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If the board fills up without a winner, the game is a draw.

Core Requirements
The Board: Represent the 3x3 grid using a Python list (e.g., a list of 9 items or a 3x3 matrix).
Visuals: Print the board to the console after every turn so players can see the game state.
Game Loop: The game must run continuously until a win or tie occurs.
Input: You must handle user input to select a spot.
Replay: After a game finishes, ask the users if they want to play again.
3. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
I recommend structuring your code using the following functions. This modular approach will make your code easier to debug and grade.

Step 1: Initialize the Board
Create a variable to store the state of the board. You may use a list of 9 strings (e.g., [" ", " ", " ", ...]) or a list of 3 lists.
Hint: The board should start empty or with placeholder numbers (1-9) to help users choose a spot.
Step 2: Display Function
Write a function print_board(board) that accepts the list and prints it in a user-friendly format.

Example Output:
Plaintext
 X | O |
---+---+---
   | X |
---+---+---
 O |   | X

Step 3: Input Handling
Write logic to prompt the current player for their move.
Validation: You must ensure:
The input is a number (or valid coordinate).
The number is within the valid range (1-9 or 0-8).
The chosen spot is not already occupied.
If the input is invalid, alert the user and ask for input again; do not crash the program.

Step 4: Win & Tie Logic
After every move, check the game state.
Win: Check all 3 rows, 3 columns, and 2 diagonals. If any contain three of the same symbol, the game ends.
Tie: If there are no empty spots left and no winner, declare a tie.

Step 5: The Game Loop
Combine everything in a main() function.
Set the current player (usually 'X' starts).
Loop until the game is over.
Inside the loop: Print board -> Get Move -> Check Win/Tie -> Switch Player.
Once the loop breaks, print the final result.
