## Measure of Artificial Intelligence Similarity 🗿 (MOAIS) 

MOAIS is a tool designed to assess the similarity between automated code snippets and human-written code. This project is inspired by Stanford's Measure of Software Similarity (MOSS), which aims to automatically detect software plagiarism.

See the original MOSS paper for more details:

#### How is MOAIS unique?

- MOAIS uses AI itself to analyze code snippets and determine similarity.
- Given a programming assignment and rubric, MOAIS generates hundreds of solutions to the problem, which are then compared against the human-written code to assess similarity.
- MOAIS follows the Monte Carlo method to measure code similarity.
